                                                <p>In this age of innovation when every technological update brings faster speeds while cutting time, and with Moore’s law in full flow, we are experiencing faster processors, graphic cards, RAMs, and even cost effective head mounting displays (HMDs), like the Google Cardboard for instance, including host of other technological advancements.</p>
                                                <h4>VR: Critical for Organizations</h4>
                                                <p>It is very critical to realize that the organizations need to stay abreast with the latest trends. And to effectively optimize worker productivity levels while addressing and overcoming the skills gap, implementing the best training methodologies prove as a game-changer for many organizations to boost their productivity while indirectly impacting their revenues for the good. Training is a crucial part of a company’s success, and it must be noted that effective training methodologies are the ones where retention is maximum.</p>
                                                <p>The brain is programmed to forget information, but with the implementation of state-of-the-art tech-enabled training methodologies such as the one AR (augmented reality) and VR has to offer, the brain can be reprogrammed and the training experience can be made more entertaining while significantly boosting the retention rates. Plus, there is always an option of going to various parts of the module and bridging the skills gap, along with the areas which require immediate attention, with the help of the various VR analytics tool, something which we will touch upon in another blog.</p>
                                                <h4>High Quality Content</h4>
                                                <p>Creating high-quality and engaging content which are aligned well with the end objectives along with a strong storyboarding, is at the heart of any great training pedagogy, and herein lies the art of creating a mesmerizing and enriching training experience for the trainees. VR content is touted to be the most engaging in this regards, and only a handful of experts have mastered this art, while a few other passionate professionals are living up to the expectations, or will do so in the near future.</p>
                                                <p>The learn-by-doing methodology by replicating real-life experiences in the virtual world, and motivating the trainees to explore new horizons at each and every step, is something which VR-based environment does successfully, allowing them to learn, un-learn, act and re-learn various skills and tools.</p>
                                                <h4>What Research Suggests?</h4>
                                                <p>Let’s face it, we all know that employees feel that that the current training programs are a boring routine, and for those working in a monotonous job role, like the ones in the Process Industry, such as control-room operators, field operators, and maintenance professionals, training forms a crucial part of the daily operations – learn more about how AR and VR is helpful for field service solutions in this blog. Simulations mimicking the accidents, potential hazards or risks become more feasible in a virtual environment while making the training more effective and hands-on, the companies need not have to worry about losses anymore. All this complements the fact that VR ensures that there is a fun element attached to each and every training, and with each level the user passes, he/she is motivated to cross the next hurdle more passionately, while understanding the complex scenarios with ease with the help of visual, audio and immersive aids.</p>
                                                <p>According to a research, it quotes, “The integration of a VE (virtual environment), together with the possibility to interact with its sections, devices, and equipment in a multiplayer fashion can foster memory retention, tasks automation, and transfer of training effects to real-life situations while developing the ability to filter out irrelevancies and focus the attention on variables that affect performance”.</p>
                                                <p>VR-enabled training provides a more immersive experience, while the engagement levels of the trainees increase significantly.</p>
                                                <p>According to our research, the user retention seems to have increased by more than 80% with the introduction of VR training methodologies, and we believe that more than 50% (a conservative figure) of the high consequence companies will be using VR Games/Simulations as a top learning priority by 2020, which is right about now. As per a research, the figure was 30% as of 2017.</p>
                                                <p>Consequently, with the use of VR technology by companies in their training processes, it has also overseen an increase in the loyalty of the workforce due to better learning experiences, while also increasing the morale of the workers.</p>
                                                <p>According to another article, Senior Director of Central Operations of Wal-Mart, Brock McKeel says, “VR gives us a practical, scalable way to teach new skills, gives associates more confidence in their jobs and makes work more exciting and fun.” He went on to further say that “employee engagement increased as a result of the training, even among employees who merely watched co-workers participate in the simulation”.</p>
                                                <p>We are hoping for the best, and as per our reports collected from on-grounds implementation and feedback, the learners are really loving the VR-enabled training methodology, and it will only get better with time, with the mixed reality coming into the picture as well, along with VR Analytics features.
